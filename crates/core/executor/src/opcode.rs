/// An opcode (short for "operation code") specifies the operation to be perfomed by the processor.
///
/// In the context of the RISC-V ISA, an opcode specifies which operation (i.e., addition,
/// subtraction, multiplication, etc.) to perform on up to three operands such as registers,
/// immediates, or memory addresses.
///
/// While the SP1 zkVM targets the RISC-V ISA, it uses a custom instruction encoding that uses
/// a different set of opcodes. The main difference is that the SP1 zkVM encodes register
/// operations and immediate operations as the same opcode. For example, the RISC-V opcodes ADD and
/// ADDI both become ADD inside the SP1 zkVM. We utilize flags inside the instruction itself to
/// distinguish between the two.
///
/// Refer to the "RV32I Reference Card" [here](https://github.com/johnwinans/rvalp/releases) for
/// more details.
